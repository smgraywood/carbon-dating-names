<h3>Can this application be productionized to harvest revenue? If yes, how?</h3>
Yes, this application couild be used by political campaigns to predict the age of their constiuency. This would enable them to make predictions about the generational skew of their constituents, allowing them to decide what issues to focus on and what issues to step away from. This technology in this app could be paired with a list of names from voter roles and be used in this manner. 
This application could also be used in clubs and event venues in order to help the DJ/performer decide what mix of music to play in order to relate to the people on the guest list for parties and events. This would allow music venues to have a predetermination of the set list and allow the performer/DJ to focus on engaging with listeners in other ways.
