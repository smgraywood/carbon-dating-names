<h3>a. Thought process to build the solution </h3>
    - We need a frontend which allows users to input a name and to receive back an age.
    - No database requested, though this could potentially be paired with a database to increase usability.
    
<h3>b. Assumptions made (in the absence of specific instructions, we expect you to make educated assumptions to move forward) </h3>

<h3>c. Improvements youâ€™d like to make on the code base </h3>
