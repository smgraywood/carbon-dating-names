<h3>a. Thought process to build the solution </h3>
    -Creation of design
    -Think through what tasks need to be accomplished in what order
        -We need a frontend which allows users to input a name and to receive back an age.
        -No database requested, though this could potentially be paired with a database to increase usability.
        -We need an elegant UI/UX
        -Think about how these things can compliment one another
    - Build basic UI in order to play with API
    -Build out API
    -Go back to update front end, create better UI/UX
<h3>b. Assumptions made (in the absence of specific instructions, we expect you to make educated assumptions to move forward) </h3>
    -Assumed we should make all parts of the API accessible
    -Assumed API could work with names and country call in tandem
    -Assumed only one country could be used

<h3>c. Improvements youâ€™d like to make on the code base </h3>
    -I would like to work on the logic behind the multiple names in order to allow users to input the list in multiple forms and still have the API call work
